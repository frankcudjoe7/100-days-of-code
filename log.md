# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got introduced to the fundamentals of web development

Started off with fundamentals of web development with [@AndreiNeagoie](https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie) complete web dev course on: How the browser works, The World wide web & the internet, How the browser works, Web languages - HTML, CSS, JS, Chrome Developer Tools..
Initially, I wasn't pleased with the fact that the first sections had no coding but I realized as I watched on how beautiful the internet architecture is, the technicalities of the web and how important they all are in web development. Used John Duckett's book on HTML & CSS too.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed the starter pack. Was so happy to really understand new concepts how the internet works and how different it is from the world wide web

### Day 2: January 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started with HTML basics. Learnt about elements, tags, attributes, text(headings, paragraphs, etc), lists, links, images, tables. Day was almost up but I made some sites to practice.

**Thoughts**: They're quite basic though but I think they implemented the concepts really well.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about HTML forms, inputs, buttons, labels, groups,etc. 

**Thoughts** Still too basic but little progress is better than no progress at all.
